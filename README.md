## Introduction
This is a Kodi (formerly known as xbmc) plugin for Openhab.  It allows users to control Openhab from within the Kodi environment.  The orignal project was created for xmbc originally created by a group RICM5 2014 students. The original page in French is located here http://air.imag.fr/index.php/Extensions_XBMC.

The code as it stands now is compatible with the Kodi (Helix) the current version at the time of writing this.

## Installation and Usage

DO NOT Use the zip downloaded with ZIP button on this page directly on Kodi, it downloads the source tree which is not an addin zip.
